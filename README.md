#  NLeSc Analytics Special Interest Group (SIG)

The mission of this SIG is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center, as well as their technical implementations. We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black-box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone.

We meet roughly every 4 weeks and have, in between, also shared sessions with with Machine Learning SIG.

If you would like to present or invite an external speaker, please feel free to subscribe for any of the upcoming sessions in the table below using a pull request or by opening an [issue](https://github.com/NLeSC/analytics-sig/issues).

Contact persons
- Flavio Hafner (f.hafner@esciencecenter.nl)
- Johan Hidding (j.hidding@esciencecenter.nl)


## Current schedule
See the [markdown file](./current_schedule.md)

## Bring your own analytical challenges

Do you encounter statistics/mathematics problems in your projects? You can bring your issue to the SIG -- we can look at the issue together and do our best to find an applied analytical solution.

### What do you need?

 - Open an issue on GitHub and label it `Help | Title`.
 - Describe the type of issue you want to address. Make sure to include:
    - What is the final goal?
    - What is the challenge?
    - A sample of your code (if possible).

We will discuss your issue during the next SIG meeting.

## Share your statistics/mathematics solutions

Did you do something really cool? Share your experiences with the SIG! Contact the SIG to arrange a presentation in one of the upcoming sessions.
