## Minutes

### Topics and contributed speakers

- Finding topics and contributed speakers is hard
    - Try to get them from the projects
    - Feeling of chasing project partners and colleagues
    - Perhaps reduce the frequency of meetings? Or at least don't be shy about leaving empty spots
    - Use the monday standups to ask people
        - Better ask them personally than generically
    - Johan will ask the collaborators in Windfarms again
    - Pablo will ask the collaborators in Parkinson
    - Dafne is starting two new projects now. Too early to know


### Study group
- Sara is ok with organizing the study group
    - Finding useful resources is the hardest part
- Study group can be easily expanded to cover empty slots
- Study group doesn't work well for introvert studying types
    - But it seems to work quite well for most people :)

### Opening SIGs to external participants
- Which sessions do we want to open?
- How to announce them?
    - Newsletter, twitter, ... as many as possible (the community managers will take care of this)
- We need a planning
- There are some concerns about what should be public and what not
- What do we want to achieve?
- We'll have a brainstorming session about this
