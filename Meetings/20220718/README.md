## Minutes

- Sarah introduced the **SIG history**
    - It began as a Statistics SIG
    - It evolved into Analytics
    - Sarah introduced study groups
    - NumTech SIG informally merged into Analytics SIG

- The SIG seems to be attracting less people than before
    - Main problem: people is busier than ever

- Open the SIG to everyone
    - Joris is very interested in this
    - Requires planning a calendar in advance
    - Perhaps attach to the newsletter

- Inviting externals
    - There is no budget for this
    - Be transparent about this fact

- Every year a proposal had to be submitted to the Tech Leads
    - Perhaps invite the Tech Leads to the brainstorming sessions?

- It would be **great to have an overview of all SIGs**

- Why not publishing (some) of our **videos to YouTube**
    - Making ourselves relevant with content
    - Write a proposal (Pablo R. and Artur)

- Possible welcome talks
    - Structure preserving methods
    - Kinematics with a smartphone
    - ~29 August or 12 September?

- It would be great to handle our own calendar
    - Contact Tech Leads about this?

- Add Artur to the leads chat
    - Remove Dafne and Sarah
